#  Example manual creation of Workflow using Injector.
#
#  NOTE: The elements passed to the "constructor" MUST be in numerical order. The key's are not used in anyway.
#
#        E.g. 'name: MyWorkflow' is actually passed to __construct() as '[ 0 => "MyWorkflow" ]' the the key being
#             what order and position it was located within 'constructor:'.
